# Kinnex Data Analysis for the HPRC Release 2

This repository provides Nextflow workflows for analyzing PacBio Kinnex long-read RNA sequencing data from 206 individuals in the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) Release 2.

The workflows cover the full pipeline from preprocessing raw reads to downstream QTL mapping, enabling reproducible analysis of expression and regulatory variation.

## Steps

1. Preprocessing
2. Read Alignment
3. Transcript Discovery
4. Transcript Quantification
5. QTL mapping
